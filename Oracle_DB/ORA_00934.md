## ORA-00934: group function is not allowed here

### Environment
- Language: Oracle

<br/>

### Problem

```sql
  SELECT Email
    FROM Person
   WHERE COUNT(*) > 1
GROUP BY Email
;
```

<br/>

### Cause of Problem
GROUP BY가 사용되었지만 WHERE 조건절이 GROUP BY보다 먼저 실행되어 오류 발생 <br/>

* SELECT 구문 실행 순서
  * FROM/JOIN -> `WHERE` -> `GROUP BY` -> HAVING -> SELECT -> ORDER BY

<br/>

### Solution
* GROUP BY 이후 실행되는 조건절인 HAVING 사용

```sql
  SELECT Email
    FROM Person
GROUP BY Email
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
;
```

<br/>
